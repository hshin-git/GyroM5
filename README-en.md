# Note
The details are as follows.

## Wiring
Wire GyroM5/M5StickC to RC receiver/servo units, as explained in the table below.

![GyroM5-hardware](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64751855/128596160-57cea8d3-d4de-4b73-8d0f-7e85df9dcbab.png)

|M5StickC |in/out |RC units |
|---- |---- |---- |
|G26  |in | Reciever CH1|
|G36 |in | Reciever CH3|
|G0 |out | Servo CH1|
|GND |in | Reciever minus|
|5Vin |in | Reciever plus|

An example image of assembled wire harness is as follows.

Caution:
Signal levels in M5StickC (3.3v) and RC units (5.0v or more) are generally different.
My RC units use 5.0-6.0v and work no trouble with directly connected M5StickC. 
But higher volotage (over 6.0v) RC units may damage your M5StickC.

## Turning On/off
M5Stick is known to have bugs in its power managment.
Find hints for trouble-shooting with google search like keyword "m5stickc not turning on".



## Monitoring LCD
GyroM5 has five states below.
One state transits to anothr state at button [A]/[B] or timeout event.

![GyroM5-state](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64751855/128596141-f6c28196-3827-4584-86fa-db1593254b71.png)

- State "HOME" is the home, transits to "WIFI" by [A] and transits to "ENDS" by [B].
- State other than "HOME" accepts A/B button or returns to "HOME" by timeout.
- Remote gain tuning by CH3 is initially disabled. 

|state|transition|descripition|
|----|----|----|
|WAIT |RC signal |waits for PWM signal from RC receiver|
|INIT |Timeout |calibrates zero points in CH1 and gyrosensor, dont move RC car|
|HOME |[A],[B] |displays RC signals, IMU inputs and PID gains|
|WIFI |[A] |WiFi access point and accepts setting commands|
|ENDS |[B] |setup CH1 steering end points|


GyroM5's web server returns the following page for various setting. 
In this page, you can setup PID parameters, PWM frequency and so on.

## Tuning
GyroM5's control algorithm is explained for tuning parameters.


### Algorithm
GyroM5 uses generic feedback control algorithm "PID control". 

![PID_wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/PID_en.svg/800px-PID_en.svg.png)

In the above PID control, the plant/process is your RC car.
The target r, the output y and the control u are as follows.

- target: r = ch1_in = CH1 input from RC receiver
- output: y = Kg*wz = Yaw rate of RC car
- control: u = ch1_out = CH1 output to RC servo

GyroM5 attempts to minimize error value e by adjusting control variable u.

- error: e = r - y = ch1_in - Kg*wz
- control: u = PID(e) = Kp * e + Ki * INT(e) + Kd * DOT(e)

INT is time integral operator, DOT is time derivative operator.


### Parameters
You can confirm/adjust the integer PID gains by LCD, A/B buttons and CH1.
The integer gains (in uppercase) are normalized from -100 to 100, and are related to the real gains (in lowercase) as follows.

- Yaw rate "wz" is in (radian per sec): <br> IMU sensored values in physical units.
- Input/output "ch1" is in 16bits (0〜64k): <br> Pulse width (0〜20ms=1000ms/50Hz) in 16bit (0〜2^16-1) integer.
- Observation Gain: Kg = KG/20.0 <br> Larger Kg becomes, smaller yaw rate per steering becomes.
- Proportional Gain: Kp = KP/50.0 <br> Larger Kp becomes, more fastly error decreases but may vibrate.
- Integral Gain: Ki = KI/250.0 <br> Larger Ki becomes, more slowly error decreases, and smaller final error is.
- Derivative Gain: Kd = KD/5000.0 <br> Larger Kd becomes, more quickly error decreases but may vibrate.

Initial parameters are recommended to set the integer gains "KG=50, KP=60, KI=30, KD=10".
Special integer gains "KG=KI=KD=0 and KP=50" are as same as the setting "pass throw: u=r". 
The plus/minus sign of KG is used for normal/reverse operation in steering servo.


## Testing
My RC car for testing GyroM5 is as follows.

|RC RX |Tamiya TRE-01|
|RC ESC |Tamiya TRE-01|
|RC servo |Yokomo S-007|
|battery |7.4V LiPo 1100mAh|
|motor | 370 type|

Hints for "RWD drifting" are listed bellow.

- Larger steering angle is better for controlability.
- Faster steering servo is also better.
- Slippy tires are easier to drift by low power motor/battery.



# Roadmap
The followings are some ideads for improving your GyroM5.

- Wireless setting GyroM5 by smartphone
- Automatic tuning of PID gain parameters
- Assiting not only steering but also throttle 
- Reading PWM input without blocking
- Automatic detection of installed direction
- Recording and analysis of driving data


# Author
The author bought a small RC car kit (Tamiya SU-01) for indoor playing under COVID-19.
After purchasing, I watched the RC car YouTube channel and became interested in "RC drift car" that did not exist in my childhood.
The "RC drift car" is already established as a genre of RC car,
and the shortest course to play "RC drift car" is to get dedicated products like Yokomo YD-2.

But in my case,
I noticed the "RC drift car" after purchasing the kit,
and I believed that any RC car can perform "stable drift driving" by high speed control.
So I tried to make steering assit gyro to stabilize RWD drift driving for my small car.

I enjoyed making this GyroM5,
and I thought this may be a good material to learn programming and control algorithm while playing RC car.
So I release the source code of GyroM5 for expecting that someone use this material for STEM education,
or persuading your parents to buy hobby RC car.

I am happy if somebody could reproduce GyroM5 or customize it by themselves.

(^_^)
